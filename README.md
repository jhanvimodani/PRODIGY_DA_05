For my fifth task, I'll dive into the analysis of traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends. Using the dataset provided on Kaggle, I'll focus on identifying the relationships between road conditions, weather, and time of day with accident occurrences.

The aim is to visualize accident hotspots, highlight contributing factors, and derive insights that could potentially aid in improving road safety. Excited to further my data analysis skills and contribute to meaningful findings!

Grateful for this enriching learning experience at Prodigy InfoTech
